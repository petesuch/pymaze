GUI input for creating maze path with mouse.  User has the option to specify size
in number of boxes high and number of boxes wide. as well as colors, go vs nogo
characters, Options for speed, (delay) for display (yes or no).  The program can
simply state if the puzzle is solvable.

I would like to do testing into my understanding of what is learning and consciousness.
The seeking and memory aspect of the program is brain like.  Can I have different objects
for array points?  Can the program learn to deal with different objects?
Once learned the program can explore an object and save its knowledge to a database.

Humans learn by interacting and experimenting, and observing and recording behaviors.
So too can this maze.  Perhaps.
