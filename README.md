Herein the files used to translate a working version of a maze solving algorithm.
in Perl to Python

An interesting feature of the Perl language is its ability to create and use
arrays with names created on the fly. Itâ€™s a very flexible language.

The Perl version is called perlMazeSolverFun.pl
The python version is pyMazeSolver.py

The goal of the programs is to find a continuous path from the top of an array to
the bottom. The path can be very convoluted.

I became interested in this project when my mechanical Physics instructor.
Fereydoon Family PhD of Emory University tasked me with the creation of such a
program in the early 1980s. At that time, he was working in the field of material.
science and was interested in how, say  bars of steel or aluminum, became fractured.

I worked on a version using the Pascal programming language on the legendary
VAX mainframe.

The pascal version unfortunately never worked for me and I suppose out of guilt.
I decided to, many years later, resurrect the project and work with the tools I
had on hand.  In the early 2000's I had my first laptop, a Chembook that I
eventually installed FreeBSD on with the Perl interpreter. I also had a copy of
the first edition of Regular Expressions and with that and the nice beaches of
Thailand, I went to work.

It had always been my goal to learn other languages, so Python was the next logical.
step.

Ultimately the goal is not only to get from one side to another but to learn.
