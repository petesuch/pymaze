# pymaze

#   herein lies files I have been using to help me achieve my goal of translating
#   a working version of a maze solving algorithm in Perl to Python.

#   An interesting feature of the Perl language is its ability to create and use
#   arrays on the fly. I am not proficient enough in Python yet to easily convert
#   the Perl code -specifically this aspect- but that is exactly why I am trying.
